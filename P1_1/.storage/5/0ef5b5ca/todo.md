# Part 1 - Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) Prototype

## Tasks
1. **Documentation**:
   - Provide a detailed explanation of design choices, database structure, and GUI layout.
   - Include assumptions and constraints.

2. **UML Class Diagram**:
   - Design a UML class diagram representing the data requirements of the CMCS.

3. **Project Plan**:
   - Develop a project plan outlining tasks, dependencies, and timeline.

4. **GUI Design**:
   - Create a non-functional GUI prototype using the MVC format in .NET Core.

## Files to Create
1. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/design_documentation.md`: Contains design choices, assumptions, and constraints.

2. **UML Class Diagram**:
   - `uml/class_diagram.png`: UML class diagram for the database.

3. **Project Plan**:
   - `docs/project_plan.md`: Project plan with tasks, dependencies, and timeline.

4. **GUI Design**:
   - `Controllers/HomeController.cs`: Controller for the MVC prototype.
   - `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`: View for the GUI prototype.
   - `Models/ClaimModel.cs`: Model representing the claim data structure.

## Notes
- The GUI will be a non-functional prototype at this stage.
- Ensure the design is user-friendly and intuitive.
